- Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a Semi-supervised machine-learning approach. 

- It  concerned with learning control laws and policies to interact with a complex environment from experience

- The RL agent goes through many trial-anderror steps to maximize the reward it gets from the environment

- In recent years, A combination of deep learning and RL Classic RL is proposed as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)

- In 2015, Google DeepMind introduced deep Qnetwork (DQN) delivering results exceeding humans in playing Atari games.
